# üß™ Ephemeral Journals for Python-to-TypeScript Porting

## Overview

Ephemeral Journals are temporary Srcbook notebooks that serve as "structured journals" for sketching out and developing Python-to-TypeScript porting implementations. They exist only during your MCP connection and automatically clean up when the connection terminates.

## Key Features

- **üîÑ Ephemeral**: Exist only during the connection, auto-cleanup on termination
- **üìù Structured**: Pre-built templates for analysis, experiments, and decision tracking
- **üß™ Experimental**: Perfect for iterating on approaches before committing
- **üíæ Snapshot-able**: Save permanent copies when you find valuable patterns
- **üè∑Ô∏è Organized**: Tag entries for easy categorization and retrieval

## Available Tools

### `create-ephemeral-journal`
Create a new ephemeral journal for a specific porting task.

**Parameters:**
- `title`: Title for the journal (e.g., "FastAPI Router Porting")
- `purpose`: Purpose description (e.g., "Converting FastAPI decorators to TypeScript patterns")
- `initialNotes` (optional): Initial thoughts or requirements
- `includeTemplates` (default: true): Include helpful templates for porting work

**Example:**
```json
{
  "title": "NumPy Array Operations",
  "purpose": "Porting NumPy array operations to TypeScript equivalents",
  "initialNotes": "Focus on mathematical operations and broadcasting patterns",
  "includeTemplates": true
}
```

### `list-ephemeral-journals`
List all active ephemeral journals with details.

Shows:
- Journal titles and IDs
- Creation time and last modified
- Cell counts (total, code, markdown)
- Purpose descriptions

### `add-journal-entry`
Add a new entry to an existing journal.

**Parameters:**
- `journalId`: ID of the target journal
- `entryTitle`: Title for this entry
- `entryType`: Type of entry (`experiment`, `analysis`, `implementation`, `notes`, `comparison`)
- `content`: Main content (markdown, code, or analysis)
- `language`: Language for content (`typescript`, `javascript`, `markdown`)
- `tags` (optional): Tags for organization

**Example:**
```json
{
  "journalId": "abc123",
  "entryTitle": "Array Broadcasting Experiment",
  "entryType": "experiment",
  "content": "// Trying different approaches to mimic NumPy broadcasting\nfunction broadcast(a: number[], b: number[]): number[] {\n  // Implementation here\n}",
  "language": "typescript",
  "tags": ["broadcasting", "arrays", "mathematical"]
}
```

### `get-journal-content`
Retrieve journal content in different formats.

**Formats:**
- `summary`: Overview with metadata and recent entries
- `full`: Complete journal content in readable format
- `code-only`: Just the code cells with filenames

### `save-journal-snapshot`
Save a permanent snapshot to the persistent notebooks directory.

**Parameters:**
- `journalId`: ID of the journal to snapshot
- `snapshotName` (optional): Custom name for the snapshot

The snapshot includes:
- Original metadata and timestamps
- All journal content
- Snapshot information header

## Template Structure

When you create a journal with templates, you get:

### üîç Analysis Template
Pre-structured sections for:
- Python patterns identified
- TypeScript equivalents
- Challenges and blockers
- Dependencies needed

### üß™ Experiment Space
Ready-to-use code cells for:
- Testing different approaches
- Prototyping solutions
- Comparing implementations

### üìù Decision Log
Tracking section for:
- Decisions made with rationale
- Next steps and todos
- Timeline entries

## Typical Workflow

1. **Create** an ephemeral journal for your porting task
2. **Analyze** the Python code using the analysis template
3. **Experiment** with different TypeScript approaches
4. **Document** decisions and trade-offs in the decision log
5. **Iterate** by adding more entries as you refine the approach
6. **Snapshot** successful patterns for future reference

## Benefits for Models

- **Structured thinking**: Templates guide systematic analysis
- **Iteration-friendly**: Easy to experiment without permanent consequences
- **Memory aid**: Keep track of complex porting decisions
- **Pattern building**: Develop reusable approaches across projects
- **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive porting documentation

## Cleanup Behavior

Ephemeral journals are automatically cleaned up when:
- The MCP connection terminates normally
- The process receives SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
- The process receives SIGTERM
- The transport connection closes

This ensures no temporary files are left behind while allowing you to work freely during your session.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear purpose**: Define specific goals for each journal
2. **Descriptive titles**: Make journals easy to identify
3. **Tag consistently**: Use consistent tags for better organization  
4. **Snapshot valuable work**: Don't lose important patterns
5. **Experiment freely**: Use the ephemeral nature to try bold approaches
6. **Document decisions**: Future you will thank present you

## Integration with Existing Tools

Ephemeral journals work seamlessly with other MCP tools:

- Use `type-analysis` results in your journal entries
- Reference `library-mapping` outputs in your experiments
- Apply `pattern-mapping` suggestions in your implementations
- Document `porting-strategy` decisions in your decision log

The ephemeral journals provide the perfect scratch space for integrating insights from all the other porting tools into a cohesive implementation plan.
